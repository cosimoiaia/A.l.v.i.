A.L.V.I. Bot README file
=========================


Description
===========

A.L.V.I. Bot is intended to be a simple, but smart Bot 
that helps you with your daily operation on the net. 
It will be able to listen what you ask and give you a 
reasonable answer, retriving the informations you asked 
or doing stuff.


Status
======

For now it's able to check your IMAP mailbox as you set 
in your configfile and read you out lout a digest of the 
last unread mails.
The code for now is really ugly and not so fast... but it works :)


Many information and features will be added soon :-)


Requirements
============
Alvi needs festival to be installed and properly working.
A good idea is to install the MBrola Italian Voice too.


Installation
============
Just modify the 'alvi.cfg' included in this archive for your needs, 
put it into your home, calling it '.alvi.cgf', launch Alvi,
and enjoy his voice :)
