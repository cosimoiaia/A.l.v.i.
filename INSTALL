A.L.V.I. Bot Installation file
=========================


Requirements
============
Alvi needs festival or espeak to be installed and properly working.
A good idea is to install the MBrola Italian Voice too.


Installation
============
Modify the 'alvi.cfg' included in this archive for your needs, 
put it into your home, calling it '.alvi.cgf', launch Alvi and be annoyed by his blabbing.
(You might want to have a look at the speech code, in case you have trouble with festival, 
this will be fixed in the next releases)
